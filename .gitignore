#### 2. Create Fresh, Synced Model Files
This ensures the model and features are a perfect match.

**Action:**
1.  On your computer, **delete** these files from your project folder: `model_xgb.pkl`, `model_features.csv`, `metrics.json`.
2.  Open your terminal, activate your virtual environment (`.venv\Scripts\activate.bat`), and run your training script one last time:
    ```bash
    python f1_project.py
    
#### 3. The Final Upload
This will wipe Git's broken memory and upload a fresh, clean copy of your entire project.

**Action:**
1.  Open your terminal in your project folder.
2.  Run these commands one by one:
    ```bash
    git rm -r --cached .
    git add .
    git commit -m "Final version with all fixes and correct artifacts"
    git push origin main --force
    3.  Go to your Streamlit Cloud page and **reboot your app**.

This is the definitive solution. It gives you the best version of the app code, fixes the broken `.gitignore`, creates a perfect set of model files, and cleans up your repository. Your project will work.
